<h3>technology - wireless</h3>
<p>Wireless connectivity of sensors and actuators is becoming a fast growing area of application for building automation control and we are pleased to offer Enocean enabled products from a variety of manufacturers. Enocean is unique in that the wireless devices harvest their energy from both natural and artificial light as well as kinetic sources therefore the need for batteries and of course power cabling is not required.</p>
<p>Wireless technology comes into its own when an application runs into a problem of not being able to run cabling to a certain point or down solid walls. Building such as museums and churches are a good reason for using wireless sensors as there is no need to install ghastly surface mounted containments that would visually look out of place within the existing interior decor. Other areas of application are rooms with movable partitions, hospitals, schools and many more.</p>
