<h3>services - integration</h3>
<p>SG Controls and Integration have much experience in integrating open systems and products that use the LonWorks™ platform in addition to extensive knowledge of other systems and products that utilise open architectures such as DALI, KNX®, BACnet® and Ethernet/IP.</p>
<p>Coupled with our systems integration expertise is our knowledge of network infrastructure design for building control and automation systems using the latest Web enabled interfaces and router technologies including Ethernet and Fibre Optic backbone networks for medium to large installations.</p>
<p>Wireless connectivity of sensors and actuators is becoming a fast growing area of application for building control and we are pleased to offer Enocean enabled products from a variety of manufacturers. Enocean is unique in that the wireless devices harvest their energy from both natural and artificial light sources therefore the need for batteries and of course power cabling is not required.</p>
<p>Wireless technology comes into its own when an application runs into a problem of not being able to run cabling to a certain point or down solid walls. Building such as museums and churches are a good reason for using wireless sensors as there is no need to install ghastly surface mounted containments that would visually look out of place within the existing interior decor. Other areas of application are areas/rooms with movable partitions, hospitals, schools and many others.</p>
